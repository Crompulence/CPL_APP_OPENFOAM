Description
    Solver for a system of an incompressible fluid phase with one
    phase dispersed, i.e. particles in a liquid. The dispersed phase
    is modeled with DEM (LAMMPS)

If you are interested in a partial description of the numerical methodology 
used in bubbleFoam/twoPhaseEulerFoam, and in particular on the phase intensive 
formulation of the momentum equation, you can read the following paper:

    P. J. Oliveira, R. I. Issa, Numerical aspects of an algorithm for the
    Eulerian simulation, of two-phase flows, International Journal of Numerical 
    Methods in Fluids, 2003; 43:1177â€“1198 (DOI: 10.1002/fld.508)


The details of the implementation in OpenFOAM(r) are described in an internal 
report of OpenCFD (NOT AVAILABLE ANYWHERE) but are apparently summed
up in Henrik Rusche PhD thesis.

The basic ideas behind the solution algorithm are the following

    > do not include the pressure gradient in the momentum predictor, 
      which is not solved (only a Jacobi iteration is done to find a 
      guess of the velocity before solving for the pressure equation 
      based on the mixture)
    > move the gravity and the explicit part of the drag term to the 
      pressure equation (this approach is known in the literature as 
      semi-implicit coupling)
    > solve the pressure equation to enforce mass conservation for the mixture
    > do not correct the velocity field directly, instead correct the flux
    > obtain the velocity correction from a reconstruction of the flux correction

The last two steps are the key point, if you want to have a stable solution when sharp 
interfaces with large density gradients are present.
